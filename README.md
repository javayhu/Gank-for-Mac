# Gank for Mac

> The missing Mac OS X application for [gank.io](https://gank.io)

## Application Features

This tiny application is used to view the `gank` posts in [gank.io](https://gank.io), and send you a notification when new post arrived. Nothing more and nothing less.   
It is developed with [Swift](https://swift.org/) 2.2!!! Excited? 😜   
Btw, please make sure your mac system is OS X 10.10 or later.

Almost all the code is explained with its fuctions, so enjoy reading the source code. 😄   
Since I just learned Swift language and Mac OS X application development this week, please be nice when you read the xxxx code. 😂 Btw, other helpful features are still under development. 😘     
Feel free to submit any pull request to make it better or send your suggestions to [me](mailto:hujiawei090807@gmail.com).
